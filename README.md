# crypto
This repository contains several different cryptographic algorithms that I've re-implemented in my spare time.
These include:
- Argon2
- ML-KEM
- SLH-DSA
- X25519
- XSalsa20Poly1305
- Blake2b
- AES
- HOTP (HMAC-SHA1)

None of these algorithms should be used for production systems, they were made for educational purposes only.
